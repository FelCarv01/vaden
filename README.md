# Vaden

**Vaden** is a backend framework for Dart inspired by Spring Boot, built entirely by the [Flutterando](https://flutterando.com.br) community.

It brings modern concepts like annotation-based controllers, dependency injection, middlewares, guards, DTOs, and OpenAPI documentation — all tailored for a fast and expressive Dart server experience.

Vaden aims to deliver the same developer joy Dart brought to Flutter, but for the backend.
