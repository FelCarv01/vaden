# Motivation

Vaden was born out of the need for a simple, modern, and extensible backend framework in the Dart ecosystem. Inspired by powerful frameworks like Spring Boot (Java), NestJS (TypeScript), and Symfony (PHP), Vaden brings annotation-based development, dependency injection, controllers, middlewares, configuration, and DTOs to Dart, aiming for productivity and clarity from the first line of code.

Dart is a clean, expressive language widely adopted for Flutter development, but there has been a clear gap in idiomatic backend solutions. Vaden fills this gap with conventions and tooling designed to bring the same fluidity that Flutter brought to UI into backend development.
