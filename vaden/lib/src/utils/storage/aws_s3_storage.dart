/// Implementation of the [Storage] interface that uses Amazon S3 for cloud storage.
///
/// The AwsS3Storage class provides file storage capabilities using Amazon S3, a highly
/// scalable, reliable, and low-latency cloud storage service. This implementation is
/// suitable for production environments and applications with advanced storage needs.
///
/// Amazon S3 offers several advantages over local storage:
/// - High durability and availability
/// - Virtually unlimited storage capacity
/// - Global accessibility
/// - Built-in security features
/// - Integration with other AWS services
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final storage = AwsS3Storage(
///   bucket: 'my-app-bucket',
///   region: 'us-east-1',
///   accessKey: 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
///   secretKey: 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',
/// );
///
/// // Upload a file
/// final filePath = await storage.upload('image.jpg', imageBytes);
/// ```
///
/// Configuration in application settings:
/// ```yaml
/// storage:
///   provider: 's3'
///   provider:
///     s3:
///       bucket: 'my-app-bucket'
///       region: 'us-east-1'
///       accessKey: 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE'
///       secretKey: 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
/// ```
///
/// Note: This implementation requires the AWS SDK for Dart to be properly installed
/// and configured in your project.
